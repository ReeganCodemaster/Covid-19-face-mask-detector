# Covid-19-face-mask-detector

This repository contains two models  adn two programs.

## The models

The first model is provided by opencv todetct faces in an image, the second I built myself to detct if a face is wearing a mask.
 
## The first program

`main.py` is the main program that captures a live video-stream and retrieves each face from each frame and then passes them to the face-mask detction model.

## The second program
`camtest.py` is built to test which camera id belongs to which camera for convenience
